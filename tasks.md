## Immutable Design Choices
* Input Assembly File
    * RISC-V
    * .txt
* Stages must include at a minimum:
    * Instruction Fetch (IF)
    * Instruction Decode (ID)
    * Execute (EX)
    * Memory Access (MEM)
    * Write Back (WB)


## Customizable Design Choices
* Pipeline Stages
    * Number of stages
    * Stage names
    * Substages/stage groupings?
* Compiler Options (LLVM)
    * how good of a compiler?
    * what settings are available

## Program Functionality
* Simulate pipeline or compute?
